    "1. **Nigiri**- a hand-formed ball of rice topped with something tasty\n",
    "  * Gunkanmaki - with a loose or soft topping that is held in place with a\n",
    "    strip of seaweed\n",
    "  * Temarizushi - where the topping is just pressed into a ball of rice\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Maki**- one or more tasty things rolled up in seaweed and rice\n",
    "  * Futomaki - seaweed on the outside, usually vegetarian\n",
    "  * Temaki - cone-shaped seaweed filled with rice and tasty things\n",
    "  * Uramaki - rice on the outside\n",
